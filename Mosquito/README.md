# WNV
West Nile Virus in California

1) Used Full_WNV_scraper to get WNV_full.csv (WNV_data_scraper.R is an older scraper that made the WNV.csv which is not accurate -- see 2019_explore.R which shows the messed up counts)

2) Cropped and aggregated counts using Cal_Crop_Full.R to make WNV_Cropped.csv. Also create "WNV_Counties" which has all the enties organized by county, and its corresponding shapefile, "WNV_Counties.shp". 

3) Full_WNV_explore.Rmd: Preliminary exploratory data analysis and matching with report at http://westnile.ca.gov/downloads.php?download_id=4489&filename=Arbobulletin_2019_35.pdf
